### Pt 3. Unit Testing with Jest
1) You would not want to use a unit test for the "message" feature of an application because it is testing the function of multiple parts of a program. (Input, possibly encoding, decoding, output, formatting, etc).
2) You could use a unit test for this feature, because it simply checks that a use cannot input more than 80 characters.
